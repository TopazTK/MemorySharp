## Synopsis ##

MemorySharp is a C# based memory editing library targeting Windows applications, offering various functions to extract and inject data and codes into remote processes to allow interoperability.

The goal of this library is to provide a safe, powerful and easy to use API, keeping the remote process as clean as possible. For the moment, the library only supports 32-bit development.
